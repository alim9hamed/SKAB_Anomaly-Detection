# Overview

This project focuses on **Anomaly Detection** using various machine learning models, including traditional models like Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, XGBoost, One-Class SVM, and deep learning techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The dataset used for this project is derived from **SKAB (Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark)**, a well-established benchmark for evaluating anomaly detection models in industrial settings. The primary objective is to detect **collective anomalies** in time-series data collected from sensors installed on a testbed.
